# Twist 'em up! Turn 'em 'round!

In memory of [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway)
(1937&ndash;2020), dwelling in particular on the
[Canada/USA Mathcamp](https://www.mathcamp.org/)
performance that this game is an adaptation of&mdash;during which
he wrapped the tangle in paper that he later tore open
with his teeth.</p>
